## Endpoints
### Firebase/Firestore

We used this [walkthrough](https://blog.logrocket.com/user-authentication-firebase-react-apps/) from the [LogRocket Blog](https://logrocket.com/) as a guideline to build a firebase authentication.
We chose to use `react-router-dom` in place of `@reach/router`
The sign-in generates a unique UID that we pass to state with React, then write into our collection in Mongo as our "key" to retrieve the character for the signed in user.

### MongoDB 
* POST Creates a collection with character data.

* GET reads the character data.

* UPDATE will update when the state changes for a character during gameplay.

## Set up

Complete the following steps to start a new project (YOUR-APP-NAME):

1. Clone this repository to your local machine `git clone git@github.com:LindseyM20/team-rpg.git YOUR-APP-NAME`
2. `cd` into the cloned repository
3. Install the node dependencies `npm install`

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.

## Resources for Game Logic

Beautiful sprite sheets were built with ease thanks to:
[Sprite Sheet Generator](https://github.com/Gaurav0/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator)

This tutorial for animating sprites with arrow keys was super helpful in getting us going to wire the sprites to our page using React hooks!

This tutorial helped us create an SVG pixel-art healthbar that is responsive to our React state:

Our overworld was inspired by what we believed to be [The Easiest JavaScript Game Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2BmmYr9NQ&list=WL&index=6&t=272s). We followed this HTML/CSS/JavaScript tutorial and refactored the logic to fit our React App and design.
